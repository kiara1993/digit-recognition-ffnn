# digit-recognition-ffnn
Python code for handwritten digit recognition using a simple feedforward neural network and implementation of the same in a web browser using Javascript.

The Python code uses backpropagation algorithm on a simple feedforward neural network with 784 input nodes, 1 hidden layer with 50 hidden nodes and 1 output layer with 10 output nodes.

Weight values of all the nodes are captured in a text doc, from the Python code.

Later these values are used in the Javascript code to recognize handwritten digits.
